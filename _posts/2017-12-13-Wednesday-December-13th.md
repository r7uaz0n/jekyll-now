Git version control, more command line, git review...

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

I did some real-world Git version control action this past week for the web-dev project I am assisting with.  It gave me a better grasp of the Git workflow process (clone, add, commit, push, and pull) between Bitbucket and my local system..   Currently reviewing some tutorials on working with branches.  I know this will beccome more second-nature with more doing and experience.  


Command Line:  how to make a new file
_$ echo "Earth's Moon" >> locations.txt_


## My next goals:

- Continue learning rails.
