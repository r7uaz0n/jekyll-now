This is my sixteenth blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

It was easy for me to copy the example code to solve this problem but I didn't have a good understanding of what was happening so I decided to break it down by visualizing on paper as well as used `debugger` to see in the console.log the step-by-step procedure of the code.  
```javascript

// Example
var ourArr = [ 9, 10, 11, 12];
var ourTotal = 0;

for (var i = 0; i < ourArr.length; i++) {
  ourTotal += ourArr[i];
}

// Setup
var myArr = [ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

// Only change code below this line
var total = 0;
for (var i = 0; i < myArr.length; i++){
  total += myArr[i];
}
```

I needed to understand this in order to solve another problem which involves Nesting For Loops in a multi-dimensional array which was frying my brain so I decided to leave it for the day. 


## Questions:




## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

- Nesting For Loops

## My next goals:

- Solve last challenge I got stuck on.
- watch h/w videos


# Perseverance is key!
