This is my thirty-seventh blog post: 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   
  
- A little busy these few days and haven't been able to get deep in practicing coding or watch any tutorials I had wanted to focus on.  I did get a chance to listen to another JavaScript Air podcast.  This one was called [Getting Started with Web Audio](https://javascriptair.com/episodes/2016-07-27/).  Nice overview on web audio programming with JavaScript.  

Tip from one of the guest speakers in the podcast:
> When you dive into new realms of programming, be it web-audio, functional programming, or whatever it is you're after, don't be afraid to dive in and iterate. Start with simple micro-projects and keep growing a notch every time. I find it hard to really get into new technology without getting my hands dirty from the start. Practice is essential.

## My next goals:

- Get back to practicing JS hands-on.

- Do this week's prerequisites for June's JS un(bootcamp).
