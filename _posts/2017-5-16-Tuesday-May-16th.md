This is my thirty-first blog post: 


## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- Attended the Los Angeles Computer Vision meetup this evening.  A lot of what was presented was out of my scope of technical knowledge. 

- Continued working on _Loop Warmup HW_ on this problem:

>// CHALLENGE 18:
>Write a WHILE loop that displays the numbers 1 to 10 (inclusive),
>EXCEPT for any multiple of 3, display the word "fizz" instead of the number!
>So your console should look like this:
>
>1 

>2 

>fizz

>4 

>5 

>fizz

>7 

>8 

>fizz

>10 

Got some help from slack but still trying to figure out the rest of the solution.

## What I got stuck on:

- Above problem.  Code I'm working with that is not correct or complete:

```javascript
  var i=0;
  while (i<=9) {
   i++;
   var j = i % 3; 
   if (j === 0){
     i = "fizz";
     console.log(i);
   } else  {
    console.log(j);
    }
  }
```


## Useful links to save for later:

More on Control Flow in JS Forum - [What is the usage of a modulo?](https://www.codecademy.com/en/forum_questions/543425067c82ca6013000d9f) - good explanation and use of modulus with examples


## My next goals:

- Solve last problem from _Loop Warmup HW_
- Catch up on past HW
- Review some math
- Continue to practice JS
