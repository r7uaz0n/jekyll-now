title: Day Two..... 
---

This is my second blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! In this first post, I'll share some notes on what I learned today at the first class meeting of the very first [Learn Teach Code](http://learnteachcode.org/) UnBootcamp experiment.

## Today I learned (#TIL):
Today I learned that there are different ways to visualize when problem solving. 
I learned that anyone has the ability to draw cartoons.
I learned more about using Terminal and command line.

## Questions:

- ...thing 1
- ...thing 2

## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

Writing the code how to find number of pairs.

## Useful links to save for later:

Rewatch Tedtalk videos from class:
Josh Kaufman - Ted Talk
The first 20 hours - “how to learn anything.”

Graham Shaw
"Why people believe they can’t draw
And how to prove they can."

Google - Deliberate practice
       - Limiting beliefs

## My next goals:
