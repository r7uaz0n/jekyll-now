title: Day Two..... 
---

This is my second blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! 

## Today I learned (#TIL):

Reflecting on yesterday's class during the mob programming session, I learned how much work I need on my coding fluency.

## Questions:


Is there something in particluar we should be doing daily in order fullfill the 10 hours of coding study time?
Is there a document that will be shared weekly w/ the H/W and other exercises?


## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

I got stuck on a couple of freeCodeCamp tutorial challenges that I decided to skip over and get back to.
Challenge names:  Stand in Line and Counting Cards


## Useful links to save for later:

freeCodeCamp JavaScript Basic course on YouTube!
https://medium.freecodecamp.com/my-giant-javascript-basics-course-is-now-live-on-youtube-and-its-100-free-9020a21bbc27



## My next goals:

Continue to work through freeCodeCamp tutorials and watch the new YouTube tutorials.
