title: My first blog post using GitHub and Jekyll!
---

This is my first blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! In this first post, I'll share some notes on what I learned today at the first class meeting of the very first [Learn Teach Code](http://learnteachcode.org/) UnBootcamp experiment.

## Today I learned (#TIL):
Today I learned that there are different ways to visualize when problem solving. 
I learned that anyone has the ability to draw cartoons.
I learned more about using Terminal and command line.

## Questions:

- ...thing 1
- ...thing 2

## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

Writing the code how to find number of pairs.

## Useful links to save for later:

Rewatch Tedtalk videos from class:
Josh Kaufman - Ted Talk
The first 20 hours - “how to learn anything.”

Graham Shaw
"Why people believe they can’t draw
And how to prove they can."

Google - Deliberate practice
       - Limiting beliefs

## My next goals:

To continue to improve my JavaScript fluency. 
## Today I learned:  Steps for making a blog post with git:

- Make a new file inside _/posts

- Must have format similar to:  2017-4-9-title-here.md

- Copy content from previous blog post, paste it in.

- Update title and content for today.

- Inside command line, navigate to your project folder 

- git status
- git add .
- git status
- git comman -m "My short message here"
- git status
- git push
