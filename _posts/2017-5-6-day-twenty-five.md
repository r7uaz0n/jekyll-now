title: 5.6.2017 - Day Twenty-five - 
---

This is my twenty-fifth blog post:

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- Hackathon day was fun.  Got to practice and problem solve our RPG design.  It was a good experience to team problem solve.  I didn't get a chance to do any hands-on JS coding today, unfortunately.  Hopefully we can practice mob programming correctly next time using a timer.  Time flew but we got something done that we all can continue to expand on through GitHub.  :)

Some of our whiteboard work.

- Learned more GitHub features when it comes to working on collaborative projects.  It still isn't clear though I am sure it will come with time and experience. 

**GitHub - Terminal**

*git checkout nameOfBranchHere*   // changes from one branch to another

To make new branch:
*git checkout -b nameOfNewBranchHere*   // creates new branch and switches to that branch)

*git branch*  // shows list of branches, highlights current branch

** use git push at the end of the day, not all the time

*git push origin nameOfBranch*  // not sure about this one

- It was great to have so many mentors present today.  Everyone was super cool.  


## Questions:

- Haven't figured out a way to preview these Markdown pages.  I would like to preview them before publishing to make sure formatting is ok rather then publishing and having to go back and edit and do several commits for the the blog post.   Any quick suggestions?


## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:


## Useful links to save for later:

[Grid By Example](http://gridbyexample.com/) - A collection of usage examples for the CSS Grid Layout specification.
- Was recommended to check out by Jim who was one of the mentors from today.

[lrn app](http://lrnapp.com/) - Been using this to study on my metro commutes to downtown.  

[freeCodeCamp Article - "I built a role playing game in JavaScript. You can, too. Hereâ€™s how."](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/learning-javascript-by-making-a-game-4aca51ad9030)

## My next goals:

- Continue to practice JS
- Catch up on past H/W assignments and problems to solve
- Review some math


# Perseverance is key!
