More Git review...

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

I did some real-world Git version control action this past week for the web-dev project I am assisting with.  It gave me a better grasp of the Git workflow process (clone, add, commit, push, and pull) between Bitbucket and my local system..   Currently reviewing some tutorials on working with branches.  I know this will beccome more second-nature with more doing and experience.  


>The _git pull_ command merges the file from your remote repository (Bitbucket) into your local repository with a single command.


_$ git branch <new branch name>_ - creates branch with new name.
_$ git checkout <branch name>_ - switches to stated branch
_$ git branch_ - lists existing branches
_$ git checkout master_ - switches to master branch
_$ git merge <branch name> - merges <branch name> in to master branch
_$ git branch -d <branch name>_ - deletes branch
_$ git push origin master_  - pushes the changes made on local respository to remote respository

## My next goals:

- Continue learning rails.
