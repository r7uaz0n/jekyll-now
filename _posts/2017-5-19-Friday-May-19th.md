This is my thirty-fourth blog post: 


## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- Had a virtual meeting w/ Liz w/ two others from our (un)bootcamp.  We discussed what we have been practicing and ideas for Part 2 of the course.  I'm looking forward to the next round.

- Worked on final problem of _Loop Warmup HW_ and still stuck.

- Decided to go through some Codecademy tutorials.  Good review on functions as well as terminology used when explaining things happening in code.  i.e. _passing in_ parameters to a function.  

## What I got stuck on:

- Still stuck on final problem of _Loop Warmup HW_ :

>CHALLENGE 21:
>Now change the previous loop to display numbers from 1 to 15, and change it so that
>if a number is a multiple of BOTH 3 and 5, display "fizzbuzz".
>So your console should look like this:
>
>1 

>2

>fizz

>4

>buzz

>fizz

>7

>8

>fizz

>buzz

>11

>fizz

>13

>14

>fizzbuzz 

I'm unable to display "fizzbuzz" correctly. 
Ran it through [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/) but I'm still unable to figure it out.  I'm going to step away from it, come back to it and then put it down on paper and see if I can solve it then.


## My next goals:

- Continue working on tutorials in Codecademy
- Continue on web-audio tutorial
- Review some math
