This is my thirty-sixth blog post: 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   
  
- I had a listen to a JavaScript podcast today called JavaScript Air in which React Native was the topic of discussion for this particular episode.  The podcast was from Oct 2016.  It was interesting to hear thoughts and opinions on using React Native and about what is involved and what one should take in to consideration when developing for mobile devices.

- Here's a photo taken at El Matador beach in Malibu yesterday.  Stopped by on the way back to LA from the Strawberry Festival in Oxnard.  Reminded me how important it is to feel and experience nature once in a while.
