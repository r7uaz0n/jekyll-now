This is my thirty-sixth blog post: 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   
  
- I had a listen to a JavaScript podcast today called JavaScript Air in which React Native was the topic of discussion for this particular episode.  The podcast was from Oct 2016.  It was interesting to hear thoughts and opinions on using React Native and about what is involved and what one should take in to consideration when developing for mobile devices.  I spoke with an iOS developer last weekend who primarily codes in Swift and his opinion of React Native is that it's just a trend.  I wonder if it's just a biased opinion because he's a Swift programmer.  I am interested to hear other people's opinions about this topic.  In the podcast they mention that one needs to become familiar with Objective-C again if they want develop mobile apps using React Native.

- Here's a photo taken at El Matador beach in Malibu yesterday.  Stopped by on the way back to LA from the Strawberry Festival in Oxnard.  Reminded me how important it is to feel and experience nature once in a while.
