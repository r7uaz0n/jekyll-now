This is my forty-fifth blog post: 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- Today we had the opportunity to go through some problems we got stuck on at the beginning of class.  I brought up an older FCC problem I had put off that hadn't gotten back to for sometime so I thought today would be a good opportunity to get some help on it.  I need to review more on nested arrays.  I find it beneficial for myself and I think for others to see what problems other people get stuck on.  It helps to see what others see and allows one to gain a different perspective when looking at a problem.  

- I was able to get through a lot of the review on arrays and objects HW practice.  I have one more section to finish before I continue on to work on Firebase issues which involves working on our collaborative prototype app.

- Some notes from today:

```i++``` is same as ```i = i + 1```, same as ```i += 1```

```arr[arr.length -1]```

- I liked the activity when we all had to explain how to access the last element of an array.  I found it to be a kind of cognitive learning strategy for knowledge reinforcement.  I think we all benefited from it. 


## Practice with JS objects and arrays Qs:

1) What are arrays in JavaScript and why are they useful?

Arrays store multiple values in a single variable. It is useful because it can hold more than one value at time. 


2) What are objects in JavaScript and why are they useful?

Objects are variables in JavaScript that are containers for named values, called properties and methods.  They are useful because they allow us to group values, including other objects, together to build more complex structures.

3) What are a couple of key differences between objects and arrays? (And can you find any good examples or metaphors that illustrate the difference?)

Values inside objects are accessed using properties/name/key.


```
var person = {
 name: "John", age: 31, 
 favColor: "green", height: 183
};
var x = person.age;
var y = person['age'];
```

Values inside arrays are accessed using an index.  Arrays are good for list of things in a certain order. 


```
var courses = new Array("HTML", "CSS", "JS"); 
var course = courses[0]; // HTML
```

4) What is the index of an array? What is it used for?

The index is a number used to access a stored value in an array. 


5) What is a property?

A property is the key value pairs associated with a JavaScript object.
Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.

6) What is a method?

A method is a function that is stored as an object property.

## My next goals:
- Finish _Objects inside Arrays_ HW challenge.
- Continue to work on _Add Login with GitHub feature using Firebase Authentication_ issue.
