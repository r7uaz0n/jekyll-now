This is my fifty-sixth blog post: 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- I attended a workshop tonight and on how to _Build a Twitter Bot with JavaScript_.
The bot looks for tweets with certain keywords and responds to those tweets automatically.  Node.js was used to connect to the Twitter to make our bot.  It's an interesting project yet silly as I have already received offensive replies on my bot twitter account.  I had attended a similar workshop in the past but Python was used.  It was good to use a language I was more familiar with. 

- I'm a little busy for the next month preparing curriculum for a university class I'm teaching this coming Fall.  It's my first time teaching at a college level and it's not related to code.  Also practicing for the Nisei week parade in Little Tokyo next month.  I hoping to keep practicing JS and fluency through watching/doing tutorials, attending study groups and workshops.  I purchased a JS Udemy course that was on sale based on a recommendation.  Perhaps that is something else to keep me going.  Maybe it would be a good time to start that local study group I have been contemplating about.  I haven't been doing any kind of creative programming much at all since learning JS.  Could I be losing my Max chops though also interested to getting in to TouchDesigner.  I've been feeling anxious but busy with other things as well though the fire still burns inside.  


## My next goals:

- Watch next section of Watch and Code JS video tutorials for review.

- Keep plugging away!
