title: 4.12.2017 Day Five... 
---

This is my fifth blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! 

## Today I learned (#TIL):

As I go through the freeCodeCamp tutorials, I think I tend to overthink the problems.

I watched some JavaScript videos that are part of a free course on Kadenze called Web Coding Fundamentals for Artists.  Jumped to Session 2 - JavaScript Basics to review computational thinking concepts.

Went back to one of the challenge I skipped over.  Learned more about using console.log to debug and was introduced to debugger by Liz. :)

Using <shift> <enter> in console.log is useful to add a line. 


## Questions:

- I notice that sometimes my blog post doesn't update and that I have to go through the process a few times before it does.  I wonder if I am doing something wrong. 

## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:


## Useful links to save for later:

## My next goals:

- Continue to go through freeCodeCamp tutorials while reviewing video tutorials in order to improve fluency.
- Tidy up past blog posts. 

- Perseverance is key.  :)
