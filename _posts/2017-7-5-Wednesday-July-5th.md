This is my fifty-third blog post: 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- Continued to work on fCC challenges.

```Math.random()``` and working with ranges is a little confusing.
But because it creates a floating point number, in order to get a whole number and include the max number we  + 1.  

Math.floor rounds the floating point down.

Example:

Q: Create a random whole number between 2 (inclusive, min) and 6 (inclusive, max) i.e. create a random whole number between min (inclusive) and max (inclusive)

A: 

```
Math.floor(Math.random() * (6 - 2 + 1))
```

Another interesting example:

E.g. 

```Math.floor(Math.random() * ((6 + 1) - 2)) + 2 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 2```

More useful examples:

```
// 0 - 10
Math.floor(Math.random() * 11);

// 1 - 10
Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;

// 5 - 20
Math.floor(Math.random() * 16) + 5;

// -10 - (-2)
Math.floor(Math.random() * 9) - 10;
```

- I am very close to finishing the Basic JS challenges on fCC. 

- I am still on-call for jury duty this week.  So far no reporting yet but need to check online status again tomorrow.
