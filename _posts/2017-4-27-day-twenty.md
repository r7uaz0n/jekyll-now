This is my twentieth blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- Continued working on 2D breakout game.  

- Based on a Slack discussion,  looks like I can brush up on some math at Khan Acaedmy  


## Questions:


## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

2D breakout game.  
On the section:
> Allowing the user to control the paddle
The second part says:  
_Add the following lines just above the setInterval() line at the bottom of your JavaScript:_
```javascript
document.addEventListener("keydown", keyDownHandler, false);
document.addEventListener("keyup", keyUpHandler, false);
```

But where it says to:
> Compare your code
these lines are not above the `setInterval()` line but rather  just below the variables.

I will backtrack and and then continue on.

## My next goals:

- Finish 2D breakout tutorial


# Perseverance is key!
