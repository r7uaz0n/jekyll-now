This is my twenty-ninth blog post:

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- Was going through the Loop Challenge HW and was stuck on one particular and asked Will about it to see how he would solve it.

> // CHALLENGE 10:  
// Write a WHILE loop that displays every ODD number from 10 to 1, counting DOWN.
/* So your console should look like this:

9 

7 

5 

3 

1 


Solution:

```javascript
	var i = 10;
	while (i > 0) {
   	 i--;
   	 var j = i % 2;
	//    console.log(j);
   	 if (j === 1){
   	   console.log(i)}
   	 }
```

I wrote it out on paper to gain a better understanding of the solution.  As tedious as it seems, it really does help to put it down on paper.  The trick was to console.log(i) when J === 1.  Big ups to Will for helping solve this challenge.  I will continue to work on other While Loop challenges.

Also used _debugger;_  in the console to help track what was doing what.
