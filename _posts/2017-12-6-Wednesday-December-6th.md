This is my fifty-eighth blog post: 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- LA is in fire. 

- It has been a while since my last blog post.  Not to say that I have stopped learning but have been more focused on my first semester of teaching at a university.  I have been attending various meetups from hardware hacking to creative coding.  I've expanded my network and made some new friends through these channels.  

- A friend of mine has asked me to help him out on a freelance web project he has been working on.  He has been busy working at a tech company fulltime coding and wanted to unload some of his freelance work.  So it looks like I will be learning ruby on rails and also doing some HTML and SCSS while also practice code reviewing using bitbucket.  I figured I needed to brush up on my command line skills with git.  I am looking forward to this opportunity. 



## My next goals:

- Get ramped up on the rails project.
