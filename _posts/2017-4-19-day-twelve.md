This is my twelfth blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- I started the Git interactive tutorial.  I learned that I can use git add "file.name" to specify which file to add.  
- I learned I can also use wildcards (*.txt) when wanting to add a set of files with the same extension.
- I learned about git log which lists the log of all the changes that have been committed so far.



## Questions:




## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

I got stuck working on a challenge on Testing Objects for Properties.  Something tells me it's not as difficult as it appears to be as I tend to overthink some of these problems.  Need to go back and review objects and how to modify functions.


## Useful links to save for later:

## My next goals:

- Work on HW.
- Continue to work through freeCodeCamp challenges
- Continue to work to improve JavaScript fluency. 


# Perseverance is key!
