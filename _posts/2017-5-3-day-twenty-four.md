This is my twenty-fourth blog post:

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- Felt kind of out of it the last few days.  I think I've hit one of those points where I don't feel like I'm improving or that things aren't sinking in so easily.  Jumped back to doing Codecademy tutorials though I'm still in the beginner part because I've been mostly using freeCodeCamp.  Should I watch some videos?

- Today I went to an Intro to 360 video & Virtual Reality workshop at the DevLab at AT&T.  No coding involved at all but rather introducing some of the software and hardware tools being used to produce media.  Looks like this kind of media is in demand.  There were 3 Labs

    * Lab 1:  360 Still Images
        * Worked on this:  [https://roundme.com/tour/147423/view/372594/](https://roundme.com/tour/147423/view/372594/)
        * Imported two stills and created 3 hotspots and audio.  It was nice to work with sound in VR.    
    * Lab 2:  Uploading to YouTube
        * Uploaded a [360 video to YouTube](https://youtu.be/ga-39qJyF8c)
    * Lab 3:  Did a small virtual reality lab creating a camera, lighting, 3D objects, physics and materials using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/).

- In the evening I went to a meetup workshop on how to make a Twitter bot in python.  It was interesting doing something with the Twitter API.

## Questions:

- Is there a good online resource or tutorial on how to make flowcharts?

## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:


## Useful links to save for later:

[Roundme](https://roundme.com/)
[Codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com)

## My next goals:

- Come up with some JavaScript project ideas. 
- Practice coding in JS.


# Perseverance is key!
