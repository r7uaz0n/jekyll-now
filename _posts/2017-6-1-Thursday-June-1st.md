This is my thirty-eighth blog post: 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   
 
- Long weekend road trips are great but now I feel rusty and behind on my coding practice.  I also haven't blogged for a week.  Excited to get back in to coding and start part 2 of JS (un)bootcamp.  I had a lot of goals I wanted to accomplish before part 2 started but I never got close to getting around to any of them.  

## HW
As a learner of JavaScript, I would be interested in having a feature that displays users who are logged in and available to collaborate for pair programming as well as a feature which links to projects a user is working so that the pair can continue working on it. Perhaps a link to a Git repository of a project.



## My next goals:

- make a sketch for the user story based on Liz's feedback.  :)

# Read-Search-Ask

# Perseverance is key!
