This is my tenth blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

Was a little busy preparing for an interview and editing CV and portfolio.

- When exporting a word doc as a PDF in Word, it's important to select the appropriate setting - printable version vs electronic distribution/accessability.  Sometimes a box surrounds email or weblinks when the documented is printed and it doesn't look very nice.  But then again, who prints these days?    


## Questions:


- Is there a Git mobile app available which could perform the same tasks as Terminal?

- Do web developers use WYSIWYG web design software such as Adobe Muse or Adobe Dreamweaver? :)


## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:



## Useful links to save for later:

- [Scalar](http://scalar.usc.edu/) 



## My next goals:

- Solve last weeks challenges.
- Continue to work through freeCodeCamp tutorials
- Become more fluent with functions and nesting


# Perseverance is key!
