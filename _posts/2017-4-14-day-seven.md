This is my sixth blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- had some trouble updating my blogs.  I may have been titling them incorrectly as I went back to tidy things up.  Debugging Markdown is fine but rather be focusing on JavaScript.  :)

HW - Challenge 1:
```javascript
    PROGRAMMING CHALLENGE 1:   
  Write a function that answers the question,
  "How many UNIQUE pairings would we have if everyone in our
  group did one pair programming session with everyone else?"
```
Looking back at my notes:

The chart below lists numPeople which represents the total number of people and uniquePairs is the unique pairs.  The pattern I see is that the difference in the uniquePairs is increased by 1 with every increase in numPeople. 
How do I code this?

var = numPeople 
numPeople = i
i = 2


| numPeople ||  uniquePairs |
| ----------|| ------------ |
| 2         ||    1         |
| 3         ||    3         |
| 4         ||    6         |
| 5         ||    10        |
| 6         ||    15        |
| 7         ||    21        |
| 8         ||    28        |
| 9         ||    36        |
| 10        ||    45        |
