---

This is my sixth blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- Had some trouble updating my blogs.  I may have been titling them incorrectly as I went back to tidy things up.  Debugging Markdown is fine but rather be focusing on JavaScript.  :)
- I am getting quicker using Git via Terminal to publish blogs.  Using up arrow is useful.


I am putting off freeCodeCamp to work on Programming Challenge(s) 

## Homework
> ***********   PROGRAMMING CHALLENGE 1:   *********** 
>  Write a function that answers the question,
>  "How many UNIQUE pairings would we have if everyone in our
>  group did one pair programming session with everyone else?"

Looking back at my notes:

![image_of_visualized_sketch](https://r7uaz0n.github.io/images/sketch1.jpg)

> The chart below lists numPeople which represents the total number of people and uniquePairs is the unique pairs.  The pattern I see is that the difference in the uniquePairs is increased by 1 with every increase in numPeople. 
How do I code this?


| numPeople ||  uniquePairs |
| ----------|| ------------ |
| 2         ||    1         |
| 3         ||    3         |
| 4         ||    6         |
| 5         ||    10        |
| 6         ||    15        |
| 7         ||    21        |
| 8         ||    28        |
| 9         ||    36        |
| 10        ||    45        |


- Trying to figure out formula:

| numPeople = x   |     | uniquePairs = y   |
|---------------  |---  |-----------------  |
| x = 2           |     | y = 1             |
| x++ = 3         |     | y + 2 = 3         |
| x++ = 4         |     | y + 3 = 6         |
| x++ = 5         |     | y + 4 = 10        |
| x++ = 6         |     | y + 5 = 15        |
| x++ = 7         |     | y + 6 = 21        |
| x++ = 8         |     | y + 7 = 28        |
| x++ = 9         |     | y + 8 = 36        |
| x++ = 10        |     | y + 9 = 45        |








> ***********   PROGRAMMING CHALLENGE 2:   ***********
> If you finish challenge #1 above, here's an alternate version:
> Write a function that takes an array of names and outputs a
> string showing every unique pairing, in a format similar to:
> "Amy and Bob, Amy and Cindy, Bob and Cindy" as one example.

## Questions:

I can visualize the pattern as seen in table above.  How do I come up with the formula?  
How can I develop this skill?  I assume that I should practice more math.


## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

- Still can't figure out how to display tables properly using Markdown.  


## Useful links to save for later:

- Came across an article called [Coding Is An Art-Software People Should Learn "Art Thinking"](https://www.fastcompany.com/3019082/coding-is-an-art-software-people-should-learn-art-thinking)

I haven't had a chance to go through it but it looks interesting.  Will get to it in the next couple days. 

- As I was searching for a way to properly display tables using Markdown, I came across a [Markdown Tables Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables#) website.

## My next goals:



# Perseverance is key!
