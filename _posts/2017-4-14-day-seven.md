This is my sixth blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- had some trouble updating my blogs.  I may have been titling them incorrectly as I went back to tidy things up.  Debugging Markdown is fine but rather be focusing on JavaScript.  :)

HW - Challenge 1:

>    PROGRAMMING CHALLENGE 1:   
>  Write a function that answers the question,
>  "How many UNIQUE pairings would we have if everyone in our
>  group did one pair programming session with everyone else?"

Looking back at my notes:

![image_of_visualized_sketch](https://r7uaz0n.github.io/images/sketch1.jpg)

The chart below lists numPeople which represents the total number of people and uniquePairs is the unique pairs.  The pattern I see is that the difference in the uniquePairs is increased by 1 with every increase in numPeople. 
How do I code this?


| numPeople ||  uniquePairs |
| ----------|| ------------ |
| 2         ||    1         |
| 3         ||    3         |
| 4         ||    6         |
| 5         ||    10        |
| 6         ||    15        |
| 7         ||    21        |
| 8         ||    28        |
| 9         ||    36        |
| 10        ||    45        |


| x = 2          | y = 1
| x++ = 3        | y + 2 = 3
| x++ = 4        | y + 3 = 6
| x++ = 5        | y + 4 = 10
| x++ = 6        | y + 5 = 15
| x++ = 7        | y + 6 = 21
| x++ = 8        | y + 7 = 28
| x++ = 9        | y + 8 = 36
| x++ = 10       | y + 9 = 45



```javascript
function uniquePairs (numPeople){
  numPeople = i;
for (var i = 2; i<=numPeople; i++) 
}
 
    return uniquePairs;

console.log(numPeople);

numPeople(8); 
```
