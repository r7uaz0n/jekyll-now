This is my seventh blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- Learned how to make a directory using terminal  mkdir
- How to install node.js


Functions - Parameters vs arguments

- Parameter is the parking space
- Argument is the automobile


Return vs console.log

- Keep in mind that console.log displays information but doesn’t save it.
- So if you want to use the output from your function later on, you need to return it!
- Return is not console.log


What is a function?
- “A piece of a program wrapped in a value” - Eloquent JavaScript
- A “black box” that turns out one thing into another thing
- “A relation that associates an input to a single output according to some rule.” - Wikipedia
