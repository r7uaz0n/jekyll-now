HTML, CSS review, 3D graphics, Arduino...: 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

Happy Belated Holidayz and New Year!

After helping a friend with his freelance web dev gig, I realized I need to sharpen my HTML and CSS skills.  I am currently going through an online course called Web Coding Fundamental for Artists which covers HTML, CSS and JS.  I am also reviewing these various languages on the lrn study app which has been convenient on my train rides.  

I am also doing  another online course on programming Interactive 3D Graphics which covers WebGL and Three.js. 

I played with the Arduino and an ultra-sonic ping sensor.  I was able to get sensor data in to the Arduino IDE serial monitor.  I want to be able to get the sensor data in to Max to control parameters in a patch as I have also been tinkering with audio-reactive visuals and shaders.  



_Search, Rip, Mash, Modify_



## My next goals:

Keep learning.
