This is my forty-fourth blog post: 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- Working on Arrays and Objects HW challenges.  Very good practice.  I wish I had got on this much earlier.  I got a late start and don't think I'll be very far by tomorrow. :(
As I work on the HW challenges I notice each problem kind of builds on the previous steps, therefore, if you get stuck at some point it's difficult to move on to the following steps. 

- Didn't get very far with the Add Login with GitHub feature using Firebase Authentication_ issue as I was focused on the Arrays and Objects HW challenges. 

- Need to keep better track and document of the things I'm learning along the way.

- Looking forward to class and working with the mentors tomorrow.  :)


## My next goals:

- Continue to work through Arrays and Objects HW challenges
- Continue to work on _Add Login with GitHub feature using Firebase Authentication_ issue.
