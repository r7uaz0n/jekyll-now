title: My first blog post using GitHub and Jekyll!
---

This is my first blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! In this first post, I'll share some notes on what I learned today at the first class meeting of the very first [Learn Teach Code](http://learnteachcode.org/) UnBootcamp experiment.

## Today I learned (#TIL):
I learned different ways to visualize when problem solving. 
I learned that anyone has the ability to draw.
I learned more about using Git, Terminal and command line.

## Questions:

Can anyone see every single change I make on GitHub?


## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

I got stuck trying to figure out the algorithm how to find the number of unqiue pairs.

## Useful links to save for later:

Rewatch Tedtalk videos from class:
Josh Kaufman - Ted Talk
The first 20 hours - “how to learn anything.”

Graham Shaw
"Why people believe they can’t draw
And how to prove they can."

Google - Deliberate practice
       - Limiting beliefs

backblaze.com - backup service
c9.io - backup service/online text editor

git-scm.com/downloads

## My next goals:

Continue to improve my coding fluency and get comfortable using command line to update blog for GitHub.

## Today I learned:  Steps for making a blog post with git:

- Make a new file inside _/posts

- Must have format similar to:  2017-4-9-title-here.md

- Copy content from previous blog post, paste it in.

- Update title and content for today.

- Inside command line, navigate to your project folder 

- git status (check for any changes)
- git add .  (shortcut to add all changes)
- git status
- git commit -m "My short message here"
- git status
- git push   (upload changes to Git)
