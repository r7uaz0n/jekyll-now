This is my twenty-third blog post:

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- Finished the 2D Breakout tutorial finally.  Yay! :)

There are some inaccuracies in the tutorial which might confuse beginners so it's always good to keep an eye out on this when comparing your code with the code in the tutorial.

Here's one example:

Lesson 10 Tutorial - Compare your code

_incorrect_
```javascript
var brickRowCount = 5;
var brickColumnCount = 3;
```

_correct one_
```javascript
var brickRowCount = 3;
var brickColumnCount = 5;
```

- Did a practice project with Liz and Nao today.  Didn't quite finish and have to debug.
Codepen here:  [Number Guessing Game](https://codepen.io/r7uaz0n/pen/JNJdry?editors=0010)

How easy I am to forget things I have learned in the last few weeks.  Need to keep practicing.  

- Have to come up with some ideas for small practice projects for our hackathon day this week.  I would like to practice general JS programming but also have an algorithmic problem I would like to solve. I may save the algorithmic problem for another time or meetup. :)



## p5.js

- Here's a pretty basic p5.js sketch:

- Drawn output:

In the future I would like to embed the sketch on a webpage and post a link so a viewer may experience the interaction.

## My next goals:

- Work on this weeks HW
- Practice JS daily
- Work on past HW
- Do another P5.js example sketch from the book
- Review some math


# Perseverance is key!
