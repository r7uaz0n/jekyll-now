title: 4.24.2017 - Day Seventeen - 
---

This is my seventeenth blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! 

- Got the broken image link working from Day 11.  I removed the image file and then reuploaded to Git.  Appears to be displaying properly now.

- Looking in to [Arrays on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) as I was trying to solve the Nesting For Loop problem.
	* lead me to look in to `forEach` method:  "The forEach() method executes a provided function once for each array element."

*Syntax*
```javascript
Syntax
arr.forEach(function callback(currentValue, index, array) {
    //your iterator
}[, thisArg]);
```

```javascript
var a = ['Rick', 'Monday', 'awesome'];

a.forEach(function(element) {
    console.log(element);
});
```
outputs:
```javascript
Rick
Monday
awesome
```
