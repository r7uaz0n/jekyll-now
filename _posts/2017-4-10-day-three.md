This is my third blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! 

## Today I learned (#TIL):

Did some reviewing and watched a few of the freeCodeCamp JavaScript YouTube.  
I find myself having a tab open on the SoloLearn.com JavaScript tutorial and referring back to it while going through the freeCodeCamp tutorials.  I think it's good to have different resources to refer to in order to get different perspectives on how things are explained or even going through two different JavaScript tutorials at the same time as things learned are reinforced.   


## Questions:




## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:



## Useful links to save for later:




## My next goals:

Continue to work through freeCodeCamp tutorials and the new YouTube tutorials.
