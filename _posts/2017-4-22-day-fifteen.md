---

This is my fifteenth blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- How to make a file in Terminal using touch.

- Tech jargon tip:  When inside an object, its variables are called properties, and its functions are called methods.

- textContent vs value
* You need to use the value property to get the text inside any form element.
* All other types of HTML elements, the textCOntent property will work fine.

**Breakdown of the JS Event Listener**  (Slide 84)
```javascript
document.addEventListener('click', myFunction);

function myFunction(event) {
    console.log(event);
}
```


## Questions:

Are there any gamified learning code websites?


## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

When I was using Sublime Text today, all the text was white until I closed and reopened the JS document. 

## Useful links to save for later:


## My next goals:

- finish freeCodeCamp JavaScript Basic challenges
- have a play with the Madlib code and make it prettier


# Perseverance is key!
