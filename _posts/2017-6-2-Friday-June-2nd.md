This is my thirty-ninth blog post: 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   
  
-  Made a flowchart for my user story.  I know Liz asked for two separate user stories but I combined them here.

## Useful links to save for later:

[JavaScripting](https://www.javascripting.com/) - The definitive source of the best 
JavaScript libraries, frameworks, and plugins

## My next goals:

- Revise use story flowcharts based on feedback. 


# Read-Search-Ask

# Perseverance is key!
