---

This is my sixth blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! 

## Today I learned (#TIL):

- Dubugger tool is great.  I was able to solve a freeCodeCamp challenge I skipped over because I has been spending too much time trying to figure it out.   

- Cleaned up some past blog posts and learned how to properly display weblinks.

## Questions:



## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

Had a go trying different paths, but till having trouble with the broken image link.  Table also doesn't seem to be displaying properly using Markdown.

## Useful links to save for later:

- The debugger tool YouTube video that Liz provided led me to a course called *Practical JavaScript* which looks interesting.
[Watch and Code](https://watchandcode.com/)

## My next goals:

- Work on solution for HW1
- Continue to go through freeCodeCamp challenges while reviewing video tutorials in order to improve fluency.
- Tidy up past blog posts. 

**Perseverance is key!**  :)
