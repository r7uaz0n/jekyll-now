title: Day Six - 4.13.2017 
---

This is my sixth blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- Dubugger tool is great.  I was able to solve a freeCodeCamp challenge I skipped over because I has been spending too much time trying to figure it out.   
- Cleaned up some past blog posts and learned how to properly display weblinks.
- I'm finding that my progess in freeCodeCamp is slowing down and I wonder if I should bounce over to Codecademy. I read somewhere on reedit that Codecademy is good for beginners while FCC is good for those with programming experience.  Though in Codecademy I am not able to bounce around and must complete each section, I think.  Perhaps I should just focus on HW Challenge 1. 

- Finally figured out how to display images on my blog: (should not be on two lines)  

incorrect:   
```

	(https://r7uaz0n.github.io/images/sketch1.jpg)
```

correct: 
```
	![image_of_visualized_sketch](https://r7uaz0n.github.io/images/sketch1.jpg)
	
```

HW - Challenge 1:
```javascript
   	PROGRAMMING CHALLENGE 1:   
	Write a function that answers the question,
	"How many UNIQUE pairings would we have if everyone in our
	group did one pair programming session with everyone else?"

	Remember: what are the inputs? What is the output?
If you get stuck, try solving it for just ONE example first.
```
Looking back at my notes:

![image_of_visualized_sketch](https://r7uaz0n.github.io/images/sketch1.jpg)

The chart below lists numPeople which represents the total number of people and uniquePairs is the unique pairs.  The pattern I see is that the difference in the uniquePairs is increased by 1 with every increase in numPeople. 
How do I code this?

var = numPeople 



| numPeople ||  uniquePairs |
| ----------|| ------------ |
| 2         ||    1         |
| 3         ||    3         |
| 4         ||    6         |
| 5         ||    10        |
| 6         ||    15        |
| 7         ||    21        |
| 8         ||    28        |


```javascript
function uniquePairs (numPeople){
  numPeople = i;
for (var i = 2; i<=8; i++) 
}
 
    return uniquePairs;

console.log(numPeople);

numPeople(8); 
```


## Questions:



## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

Table doesn't seem to be displaying properly using Markdown. Referring to above and my Day 4 post. [Day Four](https://r7uaz0n.github.io/day-four/) and notes above.

## Useful links to save for later:

- The debugger tool YouTube video that Liz provided led me to a course called *Practical JavaScript* which looks interesting.
[Watch and Code](https://watchandcode.com/)

## My next goals:

- Solve HW1
- Continue to go through freeCodeCamp challenges while reviewing video tutorials in order to improve fluency.
- Tidy up past blog posts. 

**Perseverance is key!**  :)
