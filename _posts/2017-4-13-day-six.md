title: 4.13.2017 - Day Six 
---

This is my sixth blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! 

## Today I learned (#TIL):

- Dubugger tool is great.  I was able to solve a freeCodeCamp challenge I skipped over because I has been spending too much time trying to figure it out.   

- Cleaned up some past blog posts and learned how to properly display weblinks.

- Finally figured out how to display images on my blog: (should not be on two lines)

incorrect:
```![image_of_visualized_sketch]

HW - Challenge 1:
```javascript
   PROGRAMMING CHALLENGE 1:   
Write a function that answers the question,
"How many UNIQUE pairings would we have if everyone in our
group did one pair programming session with everyone else?"

Remember: what are the inputs? What is the output?
If you get stuck, try solving it for just ONE example first.
```

The chart below lists numPeople which represents the total number of people and uniquePairs is the unique pairs.  The pattern I see is that the difference in the uniquePairs is increased by 1 with every increase in numPeople. 

| numPeople ||  uniquePairs |
| ----------|| ------------ |
| 2         ||    1         |
| 3         ||    3         |
| 4         ||    6         |
| 5         ||    10        |
| 6         ||    15        |
| 7         ||    21        |
| 8         ||    28        |





## Questions:



## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

Table doesn't seem to be displaying properly using Markdown. Referring to my Day 4 post. [Day Four](https://r7uaz0n.github.io/day-four/)

## Useful links to save for later:

- The debugger tool YouTube video that Liz provided led me to a course called *Practical JavaScript* which looks interesting.
[Watch and Code](https://watchandcode.com/)

## My next goals:

- Work on solution for HW1
- Continue to go through freeCodeCamp challenges while reviewing video tutorials in order to improve fluency.
- Tidy up past blog posts. 

**Perseverance is key!**  :)
