This is my fifty-fifth blog post: 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- Started to watch a short video tutorial on Lynda.com called _Computer Science Principles Lab:  JavaScript_.
There was a nice review on JavaScript functions.  There have been times I struggled wrapping my head around functions so it was nice to go over it again.  I think I will continue to watch different videos to get different explanations so that it sinks in.  I need to train my brain more to understand functions.  

I realized that some of the formatting of the curly braces have confused me in the past.  In this video tutorial the instructor formatted differently from what I've been use to seeing and to me it looks a lot clearer.

Example:

```
function init(newScore) {
    console.log("Setting the score to " + newScore);
    myScore = newScore;
    displayScore();
}
```

versus

```
function init(newScore)
{
    console.log("Setting the score to " + newScore);
    myScore = newScore;
    displayScore();
}
```

It's a very small difference but for some reason the second one is easier on my eyes as the block of code looks more like a block of code.  

I have also noticed that this instructor formats functions differently from what I have been used to when doing freeCodeCamp challenges.  fCC challenges would execute a parameter and passing values at the bottom while this instructor does it in the middle.  Again, one of those things that I didn't know mattered.  

I have been using Visual Studio Code as the text editor while following along which is the same text editor the instructor in the tutorial is using.  It has some popup hints that are helpful while coding. 



## My next goals:

- Finish watching _Computer Science Principles Lab:  JavaScript_ video.

- Watch next section of Watch and Code JS video tutorials for review.

- Keep plugging away!
