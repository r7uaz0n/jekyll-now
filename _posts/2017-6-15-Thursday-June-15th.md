This is my forty-third blog post: 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- Here are a couple of artsy images of the before/after hardware soldering I did last night.  The PCB board was designed using [Upverter](https://upverter.com) which we used at a previous meetup to design the board and then ordered about 20 of the boards for the soldering party.  I didn't design the master version which was printed.  It's an Arduino shield for a Simon-Says game.  My soldering job wasn't that great but the board worked and I got some tips on better soldering.

- Working on Arrays and Objects HW challenges.  Overthinking definitions and spending way too much time on the first section.  I always struggle putting things in to my own words.  It is important for it to sink in though.  I will list the sources.  :) 


## My next goals:

- Contniue to work through Arrays and Objects HW challenges
- Continue to work on _Add Login with GitHub feature using Firebase Authentication_ issue.
