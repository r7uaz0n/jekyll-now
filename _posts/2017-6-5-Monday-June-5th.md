This is my fortieth blog post: 

## Today I learned (#TIL):

}

- After Saturday's class I felt the need to review some JS.  I started watching [Watch and Code](https://watchandcode.com) JS tutorials. 
Started out with arrays and how to add and change an item in an array for a todo list.


Creating an array:

```
	var todos = ['item 1', 'item 2', 'item 3']
```

Add an item to the end of the array:

```
	todos.push("Item 4");
```

todos outputs:

```
	var todos = ['item 1', 'item 2', 'item 3', 'item 4']
```

To update a specific item:

```
	todos[0] = 'new value'
```

To delete an item in an array.  // 0 represents which item in the array to start from, 1 represents how many items to delete:

```
	todos.splice(0,1); 
```

console.log(todos);

```
	(3)["item 2", "item 3", "item 4"]
```
