This is my thirty-fifth blog post: 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   
  
- No coding done today though I did begin watching a JavaScript tutorial course called [Watch and Code](https://watchandcode.com).  The project in the course is a To-Do List.  It sounds it would be beneficial for me to go through this process prior to part 2 of the JS (un)bootcamp.  :)

- I went to the Hackster Hardware Hacking Hangout meetup today at We Work in Santa Monica.  It was nice to meet new people and chat.  Free pizza is always nice too but not always the healthiest choice. :)  It was good to get back to exploring more about hardware stuff.  Today we used an cloud based PCB design tool called [Upverter](https://upverter.com).  We were designing an arduino shield for a Simon-Says game we are planning to build. Things were rushed at the end as what usually happens as time runs out at the end at these casual meetups as there is often a sharing of information during the workshop which are always interesting to listen to.  I'm looking forward to the next meetup as it will be an _Embedded Linux Workshop/Primer_.

## My next goals:

- Do a web-audio tutorial
- Review some math
