This is my fifty-Ninth blog post: 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- LA is still on fire. 

- Need to brush up on my markdown syntax.  I remember being a bit more fluent when I was blogging more often while studying JS.

- Did some searching around on how to install dependencies related to rails.

- Watching this tutorial along the way.

[Ruby on Rails In 60 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPy0GQJLZUM)

_rails new <name of folder>_

- creates new folder and files for rails project

_rails s_ or _rails server_ 
- starts up rails WEBrick server

Open in web browser:  http://localhost:3000/
- will see Ruby on Rails welcome page

_MVC_ - model view controller


## My next goals:

- Continue learning rails. 


# Read-Search-Ask

# Perseverance is key!
