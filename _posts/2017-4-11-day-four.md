title: Day Four...

This is my fourth blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! 

## Today I learned (#TIL):


Was interested to see if I use OS X Terminal as a JavaScript console as Windows is able to using node.   Stackoverflow suggested to type following in terminal:

/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaScriptCore.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/jsc

It's not what I was looking for but console.log kind of works if I enter code line by line unless I am doing something wrong.


re: HW1 - I drew with paper and pencil the different combinations to help me visualize the problem.

The chart below lists numPeope which represents the total number of people and combos is the unique pairs.  The pattern I see is that the difference in the combos is increased by 1 with every increase in numPeople. 

numPeople |:|  combos
---------- | -----------
2         |:|    1
3         |:|    3
4         |:|    6
5         |:|    10
6         |:|    15
7         |:|    21
8         |:|    28
