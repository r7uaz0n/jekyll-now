This is my forty-second blog post: 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- My cold is still lingering but it's getting better.  Started the _Add Login with GitHub feature using Firebase Authentication_ issue.  Havent used HTML in a while so had to look up how to make a buttons with unique IDs.

```
    <button id="loginbtn" type="button">Log In</button>
```
```
    <button id="logoutbtn" type="button">Log Out</button>
```

- I'm at the Starbucks with painfully slow wifi.  I thought they might have improved it since last time I was here but apparently not.  I overheard that they are trying to get someone in fix it.  I certainly hope so!  

- I'm going to a soldering party tonight which is part of the Hackster hardware hacking Meetup I've been attending. We are soldering some custom designed PCB boards for Arduino shields for a project we are working on.  I haven't soldered in a while and never learned properly so I'm looking forward to learning some proper technique tonight. 


## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

- I had to go back on one of the closed issue _Practice displaying Firebase data_ to review incorporating event listeners and objects. 


## My next goals:

- Continue to work on _Add Login with GitHub feature using Firebase Authentication_ issue.
- Work through Arrays and Objects HW challenges
