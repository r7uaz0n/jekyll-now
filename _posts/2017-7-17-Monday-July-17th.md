This is my fifty-fourth blog post: 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- It's been a while since my last blog post.  

- Now that I finished the fCC JS challenges I think I needed a little break though perhaps taking a break is not such a good idea.  I've been struggling with motivation to work on the Firebase app.  Perhaps because I need to start over again because I really don't remember a lot of the Firebase stuff.  I have also been occupied and busy with some other stuff not so related to code.  I need to get back on it!

- I did attend a Microsoft IoT workshop through the Hackster meetup and learned about the Azure Cloud Computing Platform which involved 3 labs:  
	1. Setting up an Azure IoT Hub 
	1. Store Messages to a Table 
	1. Create a Data Visualization Web App.

A lot of the technology discussed was beyond the scope of my knowledge but it was interesting to learn more about IoT, its future and cloud computing. I am reminded of my interest in learning more about and working with hardware.

- Checked out a tech happy hour Meetup at Upload which is new VR/AR community space in Marina Del Rey.  I had a play with some VR stuff like Google Tilt Brush using the Oculus Rift and controllers which was pretty amazing.  There was also a nice presentation on how VR is being used for in science. 

- I also attended AT&T Shape at Warner Bros Studios in Burbank last weekend.  A lot of VR exhibits and presentations related to new technology and digital storytelling.
