This is my fifty-first blog post: 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- Forgot to post this again over the weekend.

- Nice to attend the math study groups last night.  Did more chatting then actual math problems but it was nice to get some insight from more experienced coders.  Was reminded about the Project Euler website. 

- Continued working on Firebase App.  I struggled understanding the issue I had assigned myself.  Decided to go back to review all the Firebase stuff we did for the (un)bootcamp.

- Continued to work on fCC challenges.

## Useful links:

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)


## My next goals:

- Continue to work on fCC JS challenges.

- Review Firebase stuff 

- Watch next section of Watch and Code JS video tutorials for review.
