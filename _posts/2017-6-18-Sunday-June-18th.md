This is my forty-sixth blog post: 

## Today I learned (#TIL):   

- Finished the last HW review on _Objects inside arrays_.  Hopefully I will get some feedback if I got any of them wrong.  I enjoyed going through these review problems.  It really helped me gain a better understanding of working with arrys and objects.  I look forward to applying this knowledge in the Firebase app.  

Here is the set of review problems:

[Review of arrays](https://repl.it/IlVK/31) 

[Review of objects](https://repl.it/IlV2/34)

[Arrays inside objects](https://repl.it/IlVj/14)

[Objects inside objects](https://repl.it/IlVr/8)

[Objects inside arrays](https://repl.it/IlVy/20)


## My next goals:

- Continue to work on _Add Login with GitHub feature using Firebase Authentication_ issue.
- Look at _up for grabs_ issues and select something to work on.
